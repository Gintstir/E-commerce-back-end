## **Description**

ReadMe-generator does exactly that.<br> As a Node.js powered command line application it creates a professional, and stylish README.md file based on a user's input. This input is created by a user responding to prompts generated with the Inquirer npm.

Here is a walkthrough of the database being queried using the Insomnia app: **[E-Commerce-Backend Testing Walkthrough](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Fq4TQsOYTVuw6dIc5TZMOIKpgSD8GBEF/view)**

## User Story:

- GIVEN a functional Express.js API
- WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
- THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
- WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
- THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
- WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
- THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
- WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
- THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
- WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
- THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database

## **Installation**

To use/try this application, first- `clone` or `fork/clone` this repository(see contributing section).<br> Install the required dependencies for this project using the command: `npm install` or `npm i`. This will install: **[mySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2)**,  **[dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)**, **[express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)**, and **[sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize)** using the command `node index.js` from the command line.



## **Usage-instructions**

Open the mySQL CLI using the command `mysql -u root -p` in the terminal.  You will be prompted to enter you mySQL password. Enter the command `USE ecommerce_db;` then create the schema from the MySQL shell using the command `source .db/schema.sql;`, you may now quit the MySQL shell by simply typing `quit` and hitting the return key. Back in the command line you can now source the seed files for the application with the command `npm run seed` this will populate the table.  Finally, enter `npm start` or `node server.js` to start and the server and begin interfacing with the database.  <br>

Keep in mind, if you make any changes to the file in the models directory you will need to rebuild the database.  To do this navigate the the `server.js` file in the root directory.  At the bottom of the file chance `force: false` to `force: true`, once you've done this use the command `npm start` to rebuild the database with your changes.  Now change `true` back to `false`, quit the server with the `control + c` command and restart with `npm run` or `npm install`.  Your changes should now take effect
